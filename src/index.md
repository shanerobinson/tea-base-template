**Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode project website.** > NOTE: This site will be in
constant flux and changing during the 100 days of this project. > [Clone this
project and make your own
site!](https://github.com/shanerobinson/sr-100daysofcode) I created this mostly
as an exercise in daily documentation and social interaction. The project
management part is generally easy as we've been managing clients and projects in
our company, [Bare Feet Studios, LLC](https://www.barefeetstudios.com) since 1996.
