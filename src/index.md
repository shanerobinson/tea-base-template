**This is a TEAstack _(TailwindCSS, 11ty, Alpine.js)_ small site/blog template.**

I created this template mostly
as an exercise in daily documentation and as a base template from which to quickly spin up new projects.

Follow the instructions in the [repo README](https://github.com/shanerobinson/tea-base-template) and you should have a local site running in a couple minutes...assuming you know what all this is. ðŸ˜ƒ
