**Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode project website.** > NOTE: This site will be in
constant flux and changing during the 100 days of this project. > [Clone this
project and make your own
site!](https://github.com/shanerobinson/sr-100daysofcode) I created this mostly
as an exercise in daily documentation and social interaction. The project
management part is generally easy as we've been managing clients and projects in
our company, [Bare Feet Studios, LLC](https://www.barefeetstudios.com) since
1996. {% wrap "p-2 rounded-lg border border-indigo-400 bg-indigo-200" %} [Please
subscribe to my weekly email](https://shanerobinson.ck.page/100daysofcode) for
sneak peeks on projects and what I found most interesting and/or difficult that
week. It's short, text-based, and also a work in progress. :smile: {% endwrap %}
## What this project/site is: - A playground for me to experiment and extend my
knowledge and experience building static sites in [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and
using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). - A place to document what I do
and learn during the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). - A site
to serve as reference for future projects. - An exercise in "getting back into
social media" after dropping out several years ago out of frustration with what
social media has become. ## What this site IS NOT: - A tutorial site with
step-by-step instructions. > IF you are new to static site generators like
**11ty**, or you are like me and began programming in high school in 1983, and
spent the last 22+ years working professionally with a LAMP stack (Linux,
Apache, mySQL, PHP) and are wondering what all this
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) stuff is,
<a href="mailto:info@barefeetstudios">drop me an email</a> and I would be happy
to consult with you and provide step-by-step instructions on how to get started
and host blazingly fast and secure sites for free. Here's the original
#100DaysOfCode project video: {% youtube "z_mzJnk31Cg", "100 Days of Code - The
Rules video" %} ## Extra... Oh... And I'm also doing [#100DaysOfArt on my
Instagram](https://instagram.com/shanerobinson) if you're interested in how an
Artist & Programmer merges those two seemingly disparate worlds...
